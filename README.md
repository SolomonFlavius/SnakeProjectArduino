# SnakeProjectArduino
## Backstory
I chose this type of game to ilustrate my Arduino skills. I started by connecting the 8x8 Matrix and then and LCD screen and a joystick.
At first I coded the menu selection and made a demo game with the "eating fruits" feature. After that I implemented other features like highscore or making the snake bigger.

## Game description
In this game you are at first a pixel that automaticaly moves in a direction and needs to eat the blinking pixels to become bigger and bigger to have a bigger score.

## Instruction on how to play
When in menu select "Start game" option by pressing the joystick then use the joystick to change the direction of the snake. Be careful not to eat yourself, also you have limited time depending on the difficulty.
